# Teaching experience

## University Tutoring

\begin{cvparagraph}
My teaching quality at Monash University has been consistently recognised with positive student evaluations and individual praise from my students. I generally teach applied forecasting and data analysis skills that give students a practical toolkit for working with data in industry. I have also been awarded seven congratulatory letters for outstanding student evaluations which indicates that the unit's teaching is among the best in the university.

# Research output
## Software

\begin{cvparagraph}
My primary research output is the translation of academic research into open source software packages. In total I have been the lead developer or a substantial contributor to more than 20 open source R packages, many of which provide tools for analysing time series data and visualisations. This software has a significant impact to the industry, with the total average unique monthly downloads exceeding 100,000.
